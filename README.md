People who search for this repository already know what the delta robot is and know why it's important. Delta robot parallel kinematic structure and high-speed capabilities make them ideal for precise and speedy tasks, particularly in pick-and-place operations. This repository studies trajectory planning methods for Delta robots, focusing on smooth motion for the End-Effector while minimizing deviations.
