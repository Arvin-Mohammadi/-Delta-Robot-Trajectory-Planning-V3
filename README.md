## Introduction

<ins>**What is a Delta Robot and Why is it Important**</ins> 

People who search for this repository already know what the delta robot is and know why it's important. Delta robot parallel kinematic structure and high-speed capabilities make them ideal for precise and speedy tasks, particularly in pick-and-place operations. This repository studies trajectory planning methods for Delta robots, focusing on smooth motion for the End-Effector while minimizing deviations.

**The applications of Delta robots** are virtually endless but mainly they come down to a certain pattern of pick-and-place or 3D printing or tasks that require somewhat similar movements to these two. Here's three applications that I worked on (PLEASE CITE MY 3 PAPERS):

- General Pick-and-Place: [LINK](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10334699)
- Pipetting Operation: [LINK](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10412424)
- Food Packaging - Not Published Yet

<ins>**Pros and Cons of Delta Robot**</ins>

Delta robot has basically two advantages at the cost for two things (I'm talking about the important ones). 

Advantages: 
1. High Speed
2. High Precision

Disadvantages:
1. Small Workspace
2. Low Workload

<ins>**Trajectory Planning**</ins> 

We have to get this crystal clear. Take a look at the following

Ok real talk here. I'm absolutely sick of working on papers and things like that. I think they are pretentious and faily useless for computer and robotics projects such as this one. I think github projects are millions of times more valuable because they provide real insight and tend to lean on explaining how things work instead of trying to convince you why the work is really important. But I need to work on publishing papers and also finishing my bachelor thesis ... at least for now. But just know that sharing this information in the raw format and purely practical way like this with the people around the world who might need it, is what makes me even slightly excited about doing this. that's what keeps me going. so thanks for taking interest in the previous projects I did on Delta robot trajectory planning. this will be the final version and I will hopefully never work or even see another delta robot in my entire life also follow me on instagram if you're into gaming üñ•Ô∏èüéÆü§ñ
